## About

Hi, I’m Constance. I created my own crypto coin Coinstance. I also created a crypto token exchange platform where you could trade ethereum token and Coinstance token. 

I wrote the Token smart contract and Exchange smart contract in solidity, and both run on the ethrerum blockchain. The coinstance is created base on the ERC token standard, and I used the web3 documentation for my Exchange. Because the decentralized nature of blockchain, the ethrerum blockchain is its own network, database, and computer.

For development, I used Truffle, which is a framework for smart contract development, and applied a test first approach to test the functionalities. 

I also seeded with truffle, and I will be using those two accounts to demo. Because my project is not yet deployed on the public ethrerum blockchain, I’m using Ganache, it’s a personal implementation of the etherirum blockchain on my computer with preloaded accounts.
